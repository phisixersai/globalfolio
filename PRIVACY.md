## Advertising

We display advertisements to support the development and hosting of this free tool.

### Carbon Ads (Privacy-Friendly)

## Third-Party Services

### Exchange Rate APIs
We fetch currency exchange rates from public APIs:

- Fallback: Open Exchange Rates (https://openexchangerates.org/)

These services may log API requests (IP address, timestamp) for rate limiting and abuse prevention. We do not send any personal or financial data to these APIs.

### GitHub Pages Hosting
This site is hosted on GitHub Pages, which may collect:
- IP addresses
- Browser type and version
- Pages visited and time spent

Refer to GitHub's privacy policy: https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement

## Cookies

### Essential Cookies
We use localStorage (not cookies) to store:
- Portfolio data (`globalfolio_assets_v1`, `globalfolio_liabilities_v1`, etc.)
- Theme preference (`globalfolio_theme_v1`)
- Language preference (`i18nextLng`)
- Ad consent preference (`globalfolio_ad_consent_v1`)

These are necessary for the app to function and cannot be disabled.

### Advertising Cookies
If you accept personalized ads (Google AdSense), third-party cookies may be set by:
- Google AdSense
- Google DoubleClick
- Other Google advertising partners

You can block third-party cookies in your browser settings or decline personalized ads in the consent banner.

## Your Rights (GDPR Compliance)

If you are in the European Economic Area (EEA), you have the right to:
- **Access**: View what data is stored (check browser localStorage)
- **Deletion**: Clear all data (clear localStorage or use browser settings)
- **Opt-out**: Decline personalized ads via consent banner
- **Portability**: Export your data (browser dev tools → localStorage)

Since all data is stored locally in your browser, you have full control. No data deletion requests are needed.

## Children's Privacy

Globalfolio is not intended for children under 13. We do not knowingly collect data from children.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Changes will be reflected by updating the "Last Updated" date at the top of this document.
